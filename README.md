# Storm-Climatologies

This repository is dedicated to codes developed the summer of 2018 at OU for a project investigating general characteristics of the climatology of storms over a 12 year period. 

ABOUT STORMS: Storms are selected in all climatology modes based on having a minimum lifetime of 15 minutes (will not be declared as storm if lifetime is less) and all data is indicative of the 40-Dbz echotop reflectivity at any given altitude.
